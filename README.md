The notebooks are separated into two folders based on the source of data. 

1. My EDA for the pitch is in `foil_data` > `eda.iphnb`. 

2. To run `eda.iphnb` you will need to download `2023_subway_censusvar_multire.csv`

3. Raw data and processed data are accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uZcIPkzq6sTAGxfVR--rEgShWm6Izdwq?usp=drive_link)
